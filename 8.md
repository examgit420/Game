Here's a Unity script that achieves the desired behavior. This script will make a cube rotate slowly, move with arrow keys, and have the camera follow it smoothly.

Steps to Implement:
Create a new Unity 3D project.

Add a cube (GameObject > 3D Object > Cube) and a terrain (GameObject > 3D Object > Terrain) to the scene.

Attach the script to the cube.

Adjust the camera's position so it follows the cube's movements.

Script: CubeController.cs
csharp
Copy
Edit
using UnityEngine;

public class CubeController : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float moveSpeed = 5f;       // Speed of movement
    public float rotationSpeed = 20f; // Speed of rotation
    public Transform cameraTransform; // Reference to the camera transform
    public float cameraSmoothSpeed = 0.125f; // Smoothness of the camera follow
    public Vector3 cameraOffset = new Vector3(0, 10, -10); // Camera's offset

    private void Update()
    {
        // Rotate the cube slowly
        transform.Rotate(Vector3.up, rotationSpeed * Time.deltaTime);

        // Move the cube with arrow keys
        float moveX = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal") * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime;
        float moveZ = Input.GetAxis("Vertical") * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime;
        Vector3 moveDirection = new Vector3(moveX, 0, moveZ);
        transform.Translate(moveDirection, Space.World);

        // Make the camera follow the cube
        FollowCube();
    }

    private void FollowCube()
    {
        Vector3 desiredPosition = transform.position + cameraOffset;
        Vector3 smoothedPosition = Vector3.Lerp(cameraTransform.position, desiredPosition, cameraSmoothSpeed);
        cameraTransform.position = smoothedPosition;
        cameraTransform.LookAt(transform.position);
    }
}
How to Set Up:
Attach the CubeController script to the Cube.

Drag the Main Camera into the cameraTransform field in the Inspector.

Adjust the cameraOffset and cameraSmoothSpeed values in the Inspector to suit your needs.
