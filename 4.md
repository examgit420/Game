# Unity 3D Basic Physics Movement

A simple guide to creating a 3D player character with physics-based movement that can push objects in Unity.

## Step 1: Set Up the Scene

1. **Open Unity and create a new 3D project.**

2. **In the Hierarchy:**
   - Right-click → **3D Object** → **Plane** (this will be the ground)
   - Right-click → **3D Object** → **Cube** (this will be the box to push)
   - Right-click → **3D Object** → **Capsule** (this will be the player)

## Step 2: Add Physics Components

### Box (Cube):
- Select the **Cube**
- In the **Inspector**, click **"Add Component"** → **Rigidbody**
- This makes the cube interact with Unity's physics engine

### Player (Capsule):
- Add a **Character Controller** (Add Component → Character Controller)
- (Optional) Add a **Rigidbody** if you want the player to be pushed by other forces (but often skipped if using Character Controller)

### Set up the camera:
- Click on the **Camera** in the Hierarchy
- In the **Inspector**, set the camera's position so it can view the player (e.g., Position: (0, 2, -10))
- Adjust the Camera's rotation to point towards the player (Rotation: (30, 0, 0))

## Step 3: Adding Player Movement with Physics

### 1. Add a Rigidbody component:
- Select the **"Player"** object
- In the **Inspector**, click **"Add Component"** and search for **"Rigidbody"**
- Add the Rigidbody component, which will allow physics interactions like gravity and collisions

### 2. Create a Player Controller Script:
- Right-click in the **Project** window and create a new **C# script** (e.g., PlayerController)
- Double-click to open the script in Visual Studio

### 3. Write basic movement code:

Add the following code to your PlayerController script:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float moveSpeed = 5f;
    public float turnSpeed = 700f;
    private Rigidbody rb;

    void Start()
    {
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
    }

    void Update()
    {
        // Movement
        float moveHorizontal = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
        float moveVertical = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");
        Vector3 movement = new Vector3(moveHorizontal, 0, moveVertical) * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime;
        rb.MovePosition(transform.position + movement);

        // Turning
        if (movement.magnitude > 0)
        {
            Quaternion targetRotation = Quaternion.LookRotation(movement);
            transform.rotation = Quaternion.RotateTowards(transform.rotation, targetRotation, turnSpeed * Time.deltaTime);
        }
    }
}
```

## Final Steps

1. Attach the **PlayerController** script to the **Player (Capsule)** GameObject
2. Press **Play** to test the movement
3. Use **WASD** or **Arrow Keys** to move and push the cube
